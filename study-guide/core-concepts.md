# Core Cloud Concepts

## What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services such as computing power, storage, and databases from a cloud provider like AWS.

## Cloud Service Models
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** Provides access to basic IT resources like compute, storage, and networking.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** Offers a platform that allows developers to build applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.

## Deployment Models
- **Public Cloud:** Services offered over the public internet and available to anyone (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- **Private Cloud:** A cloud environment dedicated to a single organization.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combines public and private clouds for more flexibility.

## Cloud Characteristics
- **On-demand self-services:** : The Cloud computing services does not require any human administrators, user themselves are able to provision, monitor and manage computing resources as needed.
- **Broad network access:** : The Computing services are generally provided over standard networks and heterogeneous devices.
- **Resource pooling:** : IT resources like networks, servers, storage, apps, and services are shared among many applications and users. These resources aren’t dedicated to just one person or program, so multiple clients use the same physical equipment at the same time.
- **Rapid elasticity:** : Computing services should be able to grow (scale-up) or shrink (scale-down) quickly depending on what's needed. When a user needs something, the service is provided right away, and once it’s no longer needed, the extra resources are removed.
- **Measured service:** : The resource utilization is tracked for each application and user, it will provide both the user and the resource provider with an account of what has been used. This is done for various reasons like monitoring billing and effective use of resource.

## Key Benefits
- Agility
- Elasticity
- Cost savings
- Global reach
- High availability
